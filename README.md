# Pep Medical

> A medical records management system built with **FastAPI** (backend), **PostgreSQL** (database), and **React** (frontend).

## Overview
Pep Medical is a CRUD application doctors use to track visitors to their infirmary. For each visitor, doctors can record multiple visits, attach structured data to each visit, and store related files (e.g., X-rays, scans, lab reports). The goal is to keep day-to-day clinical notes and documents organized and easy to retrieve.

### What it does
- Manage **visitors** (patients) and their **visits**
- Create, read, update, and delete records (full **CRUD**)
- **Upload & store files** per visit (e.g., X-rays and other medical documents)
- Keep a simple, practical workflow for small practices or infirmaries
